## Multiple importance sampling for path guiding 2025 - 2028

Path guiding can allow us to render some difficult light transport effects. But it still needs to be combined with other techniques, like BSDF sampling or light sampling. This project investigates better ways to achieve that combination.

## Adaptive and lightweight bidirectional rendering algorithms 2024 - 2027

<img style="float:left;" src="/content/dfg_logo_schriftzug_blau_foerderung_en.jpg" width="200px" alt="DFG logo" />

Aims to find adaptive methods that make bidirectional rendering algorithms more robust and efficient, and hence more practical.

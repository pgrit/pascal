I'm a postdoc in [Computer Graphics](https://graphics.cg.uni-saarland.de) at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de). I got my PhD (Dr.-Ing.) at Saarland University (in 2024), spent a few months as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie early-stage researcher in the [Computer Graphics group](https://cgg.mff.cuni.cz) at [Charles University](https://cuni.cz) in Prague in 2017, and got my MSc in computer science (2018) and BSc in Media Informatics (2016) at Saarland University.

## Research goals

My research revolves around photorealistic rendering. Specifically, my long-term research objective is to find rendering algorithms that are general and efficient, meaning they can produce imagery of arbitrary scenes at maximum performance without resorting to manual parameter tuning by a user. To that end, I explore learning-based methods that automatically adapt rendering algorithms to the input data. Generally, I strive to find mathematically rigorous solutions that lend themselves to practical applications. I tackle fundamental concepts (like multiple importance sampling), search for the unexplored potential in niche algorithms (like bidirectional rendering), and investigate better ways to go about popular approaches (like path guiding).

## Interests

Some keywords pertaining to my latest research endeavors:
- Monte Carlo rendering
- Adaptive sampling
- Path guiding
- Multiple importance sampling
- Bidirectional path tracing

Outside working hours, like playing (challenging) cooperative video games with friends, mediocrely playing music, and digital painting.
I also enjoy reading books. Here's a random, biased sample with unknown distribution of some books / series I enjoyed: A song of ice and fire, Discworld, Altered Carbon, Bag of Bones.
Oh, and I absolutely love eating good food and cooking.

## Open-source research tools

I enjoy improving workflows and building tools that ease my day-to-day work or that of others. My current tech stack is available on GitHub:

### [SeeSharp](https://github.com/pgrit/SeeSharp)

SeeSharp is a flexibility-first research renderer designed to facilitate easy experimentation with complex rendering algorithms, rapid prototyping, and effortless evaluations and comparisons. It was used for many of our recent papers and by multiple BSc and MSc students for their thesis work.

### [SimpleImageIO](https://github.com/pgrit/SimpleImageIO)

Initially started as a quick Python and C# wrapper around the amazing tinyexr header-only library, SimpleImageIO has evolved to now support numerous image file formats, simple filtering operations, denoising (via Intel's Open Image Denoise), and even a fancy static-page HTML HDR image viewer with scriptable tone-mapping.

### [TinyEmbree](https://github.com/pgrit/TinyEmbree)

A bare-bones C# wrapper around Intel's Embree ray tracing kernels. Supports simple triangle mesh ray intersections and nearest neighbor point searches (for photon mapping).

### [figuregen](https://github.com/Mira-13/figure-gen)

A Python library to assemble rendered images into comparison figures. Initially developed by my amazing wife Mira, it is now maintained mostly by me.

### [texsnip](https://github.com/pgrit/texsnip)

A Python module to compile pieces of LaTeX code into a .pdf and optionally convert to .png or .pptx. I use this, e.g., to create math snippets for figures.

### [beampdf](https://github.com/pgrit/beampdf)

A cross-platform slideshow presentation software for PDF files, supporting quick file switching, quick navigation, speaker notes, and video playback.
